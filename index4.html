                This has resulted in economic instability for nations and growing concerns of strains on health systems. 
                Traveller's coming into and out of Australia have been hit with some of the world's harshest restrictions.
                 While some Australian's have been in some of the world's harshest and longest lockdowns.
               In an attempt to slow the spread of the virus, countries have had to close borders as the world becomes divided.</h3>

            These can be attributed to harsh border restrictions in place by state governing teams.</p>
            <p class="detail"> Whereas states such as Queensland and Sydney exhibit  <span class="light"> lower percentage </span> changes for both arrivals and departures. 
              Queensland from March 2020 to July 2021 had a decrease of <span class="light"> 91.96% </span> arrivals and <span class="light"> 85.67% </span> departures.
               Sydney also had a decrease of <span class="light"> 81.01% </span> arrivals and <span class="light"> 82.00% </span> departures.
              These could be attributed to less harsh border restrictions in place by state governing teams. <br> <br>
            Because of the number of caps to passengers returning and departing, Australian's who are overseas may still find challenges in returning home.</p>
